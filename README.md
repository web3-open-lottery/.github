# Open Lottery (web3)

## What is this thing anyway?

Open Lottery is a project of mine with the goals to master solidity and web3 in general buy building and promoting real world cases. Lotteries, Liquidity Pools, etc. You could say I am obsessed. You would be correct!

Hi, I am Mark Tellez, a Mexico City based developer of over 25 years experience with this whole internet thing.

## Repositories

### /contracts

The contracts and build system (Hardhat) that run the open-lottery. Each contract must have extensive automated testing and all the code is for all to see!


### /web

The web3 (JavaScript, React) website that communicates with the contracts to facilitate the open lottery. Anyone can buy a ticket and create their own lottery. There are small fees to the platform (Open Lottery org) for development, operations, and marketing, and the operator (players who create their own lotteries) earn a small percentage as well. These percentages come out of the pot before pay out. Gas fees will also come out of the pot. The winner takes all else.
