# Open Lottery (web3)

## What is this thing anyway?

Open Lottery is a project of mine with the goals to master solidity and web3 in general buy building and promoting real world cases. Lotteries, Liquidity Pools, etc. You could say I am obsessed. You would be correct!

## Join the Team

I am looking to learn from people who know more than me. If you are or know someone who is active in the DeFi world in operations, security, tokenomics, or development, I would love to hear from you! The right people could even get into the DAO and earn a piece of the action.

## Who is "BlockchainMentorLive"

If you have looked at the commits of this project, or if you are evaluating or auditing it's code, you will no doubt see this name. Hi, I am Mark Tellez, a Mexico City based developer of over 25 years experience with this whole internet thing. I also teach JavaScript, React, and now Blockchain development, at https://devmentor.live and I have a Youtube channel for JavaScript/React (https://youtube.com/devmentorlive)[DevmentorLive] and I am starting a new channel on solidity and blockchain, which will be linked after it is up!

## Repositories

### /contracts

The contracts and build system (Hardhat) that run the open-lottery. Each contract must have extensive automated testing and all the code is for all to see!

### /web

The web3 (JavaScript, React) website that communicates with the contracts to facilitate the open lottery. Anyone can buy a ticket and create their own lottery. There are small fees to the platform (Open Lottery org) for development, operations, and marketing, and the operator (players who create their own lotteries) earn a small percentage as well. These percentages come out of the pot before pay out. Gas fees will also come out of the pot. The winner takes all else.
