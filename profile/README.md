# Open Lottery (web3)

## What is this thing anyway?

Open Lottery is a project of mine with the goals to master solidity and web3 in general by building and promoting real-world cases. Lotteries, Liquidity Pools, etc. You could say I am obsessed. You would be correct!

## Join the Team

I am looking to learn from people who know more than me. If you are or know someone active in the DeFi world in operations, security, tokenomics, or development, I would love to hear from you! The right people could even get into the DAO and earn a piece of the action.

## Interested in investing?

We are building a DAO and a reward token to allow building a liquidity pool to stake and trade the token. These tokens will be given as a reward for staking, creating and promoting lotteries, and buying tickets to lotteries. These tokens will also be used to allow interested investors to buy into the concept and earn a return from our success.

## Who is "BlockchainMentorLive"

If you have looked at the commits of this project, or if you are evaluating or auditing its code, you will no doubt see this name. Hi, I am Mark Tellez, a Mexico City-based developer with over 25 years of experience with this whole internet thing. I also teach JavaScript, React, and now Blockchain development, at https://devmentor.live and I have a Youtube channel for JavaScript/React (https://youtube.com/devmentorlive)[DevmentorLive] and I am starting a new channel on solidity and blockchain, which will be linked after it is up!

## Repositories

### /contracts

The contracts and build system (Hardhat) that run the open-lottery. Each contract must have extensive automated testing and all the code is for all to see!

### /web

The web3 (JavaScript, React) website communicates with the contracts to facilitate the open lottery. Anyone can buy a ticket and create a lottery. There are small fees to the platform (Open Lottery org) for development, operations, and marketing, and the operator (players who create their lotteries) earns a small percentage as well. These percentages come out of the pot before payout. Gas fees will also come out of the pot. The winner takes all else.
